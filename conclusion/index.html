    <p>In this final post we outline the typical flow of a causal study in relation to the main tools provided by <i>Causalinference</i>. At a high level, assuming that <a href="/causal-inference-blog/setting">unconfoundedness</a> holds true in the given problem, we can break down a typical study into two phases.</p>

    <p>In the <b>design</b> phase, we inspect and manipulate the data set to ensure that the most credible analysis can be conducted on it. We achieve this by proceeding in the following steps:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><a href="/causal-inference-blog/balance">Assess covariate balance</a> with <code>summary_stats</code>. If the normalized differences in covariate means suggest severe covariate imbalance, we can try to address it by using the propensity-score-based techniques below.</li>
      <li><a href="/causal-inference-blog/propensity-score">Estimate propensity score</a> with <code>est_propensity_s</code>, so that the following two propensity methods can be employed.</li>
      <li><a href="/causal-inference-blog/trimming">Trim sample</a> with <code>trim_s</code> to exclude subjects with extreme propensity scores. Since very little can be credibly said about such units, we should focus attention on the remaining units that exhibit a higher degree of covariate balance.</li>
      <li><a href="/causal-inference-blog/stratification">Stratify sample</a> with <code>stratify_s</code> to group similar subjects together and improve within-bin covariate balance.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In the <b>analysis</b> phase, we estimate treatment effects using a number of reasonable estimators. The estimators with the most desirable properties are</p>

    <ol>
      <li>The <a href="/causal-inference-blog/blocking">blocking estimator</a> invoked by <code>est_via_blocking</code>, which aggregates the least squares estimates within each propensity bin to produce an overall average treatment effect estimate.</li>
      <li>The <a href="/causal-inference-blog/matching">matching estimator</a> invoked by <code>est_via_matching</code>, which pairs subjects together via nearest-neighborhood matching to arrive at an overall average treatment effect estimate. Since bias can result when the matching is imperfect, bias correction is recommended.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If the design phase is done well, the two estimates recommended above should result in similar estimates due to their stability properties.</p>

    <p>We conclude by noting that additional checks and tests exist for assessing the validity of a causal study. Some of these tests (e.g. for assessing the unconfoundedness assumption) actually require no additional tools beyond what is provided in <i>Causalinference</i>. For the interested reader, please refer to Imbens (2014).</p>
