    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">By Laurence Wong Â· June 13, 2016</p>

    <p>A central problem of interest to social scientists, businesses, and government agencies alike is the evaluation of the effects of a treatment or policy intervention. Causal Inference is the statistical field of study concerning this problem, and it boasts a mature literature that contains numerous sophisticated methodology and recommendations.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, much of this literature has so far proved difficult to access for non-specialists due to its technical nature and the high implementation costs associated with the more advanced methods. The software package <i>Causal Inference in Python</i>, or <i>Causalinference</i> in short, is an attempt to bridge this gap by exposing the statistical tools in an easy-to-use interface.</p>

    <p>This series of blog posts will illustrate the use of <i>Causalinference</i>, as well as provide high-level summaries of the underlying econometric theory with the non-specialist audience in mind. For those who are already familiar with the literature, I recommend referring to the much terser <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/laurencium/causalinference/blob/master/docs/tex/vignette.pdf">vignette paper</a>. These blog posts can be thought of as an expanded but less formalized version of that material.</p>
